# Machine_Learning_Feature_Selection_in_R
In this tutorial, we explore various linear modeling and feature selection techniques using a baseball dataset. The goal is to identify the most important predictors of player salaries and understand how different methods approach feature selection and regularization.

We will cover:  

1. **Data Preparation** – Clean, Transform, Split 
2. **Explatory Data Analysis** - Visualizing the Target Variable and Pairwise Relationships
3. **Linear Regression** – 
4. **Best Subsets**
5. **Stepwise Selection** – Forward & Backward  
10. **Regularization Methods** – Lasso and Elastic Net

Additionally, we will **visualize regularization paths** to see how coefficients change with tuning parameters, and evaluate model performance on training, validation, and test sets.  

This tutorial combines **theory, coding, and interpretation** so you can both implement these methods in R and understand their practical implications for prediction and feature selection.
